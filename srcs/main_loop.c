/* Signal
**
** If the disposition is set to SIG_DFL, then the default action associated

**
** ctrl-C
** As ctrlC will just print ^C and go to the new line AT ANYTIME, we can handle
** it inside the loop for when:
** 1. a blocking command is typed, for example: grep h
** 2. if something is typed and ctrlD is typed before the return button, it
** writes ^C and goes to new line/promt.
** 3. for when command line is empty and no return button pressed (crtlC is
** pressed instead).
**
** ctrl-\
** Before the user input something, if ctrl\ is typed, nothing happpens inside
** the loop, if ctrl\ is typed, it has a different comportament).
** 1. if a blocking command is typed, ctrl\ kils the comman with a (core dumped)
** message and goes to a new line - i.e.: shows the prompt).
** 2. if something is typed and ctrl\ is typer before the return button, it
** does nothing.

/* ctrl-D
** Before the user input something, if ctrlD is typed, the string "exit" is
** written after the prompt, then the shell closes, and $SHLVL environment
** variable is decreased after any input, if ctrlD is typed, it has a different
** comportament:
** 1. if a blocking command is typed, ctrlD stops the command and goes to a
** new line - i.e.: shows the prompt).
** 2. if something is typed and ctrlD is typed before the return button, it
** does nothing.

** otherwise it'll exit, either the command or the shell).

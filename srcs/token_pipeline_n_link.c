** Returns an adress to the head of a t_list{} linked list, with following
** content inside:
**
**
** 		- t_command structure which contains itself 1-> an array of strings
** 													2-> an array of int
**
**
** 1- char	**command	-	command[0] must contains the name of executable.
** 							This name could include the path, which should
** 							be parsed by the executor function.
** 						-	command[n] must contains args passed to the exe.
** 					 	-	command[last] = NULL;
** 2- int	*fd			-	will be malloc() as an array of 3 int.
** 						-	fd[0] - fd from which exe reads.
** 						-	fd[1] - fd to which exe write.
** 						-	fd[2] - fd to which exe write errors.
**
** -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**
** To redirect fd to which called exe will read or write (to/from a file fd or
** to/from a pipe fd (=stream)) we will use the following way :
** - dup2(open_fd, standard_fd)
** It permits to make the system fd reference to our non-standard fd, which
** had been opened to reference a file, or a pipe(),  instead of screen or
** keyboard.
**
** An other way to see this :
** an executable is coded to write to an object (screen) which is always pointed
** by fd=1. We can't change the number of the fd which is used by the
** executable, but we can change the object the fd=1 points to.
**
** So instead of pointing to screen object, we can make fd=1 points to a file
** object, or a pipe object.
**
** -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**
** int	execve(char *path/to/exe, char **args, char **ev);
**
** Then, execution process will use the content of each link as this :
**
** 1 - Parse head->content->command[0] to extract the path & name of the exe
** 2 - If head->content->fd[0], [1], [2]  != 0, 1, 2 -> corresponding
**     standard fd must be redirected with the technique described above
** 3 - Fork a child which will execute the exec with execve();
